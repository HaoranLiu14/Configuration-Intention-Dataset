If jceks.key.serialFilter is configured, the JCEKS KeyStore uses it during the deserialization of the encrypted Key object stored inside a SecretKeyEntry. If jceks.key.serialFilter is not configured it will cause an error when recovering keystore file in KeyProviderFactory when recovering key from keystore file using JDK 8u171 or newer. The filter pattern uses the same format as jdk.serialFilter. The value of this property will be used as the following: 1. The value of jceks.key.serialFilter system property takes precedence over the value of this property. 2. In the absence of jceks.key.serialFilter system property the value of this property will be set as the value of jceks.key.serialFilter. 3. If the value of this property and jceks.key.serialFilter system property has not been set, org.apache.hadoop.crypto.key.KeyProvider sets a default value for jceks.key.serialFilter.",security
